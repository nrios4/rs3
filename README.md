The rs3code.zip file contains the R code needed to reproduce all results in the paper titled "Randomized Smart Subset Selection for High-Dimensional Generalized Linear Models with False Positive Control."

*** Folder: Section 3 ***
- SubsetSelectionSim.R: This is the R code used to run the simulations described in Section 3 of the main paper.
- Tables1and2.R: The R file reproduces Table 1 and Table 2 in the paper.

*** Folder: Section 4.1 ***
- Table3.R: This R file reproduces Table 3 as it appears in the paper.
- Trim32Analysis.R: This R file was used to analyze the Trim32 dataset.
- trim32meanresults_v3.csv: This csv file contains the average metrics obtained from running Trim32Analysis.R.
- trim32seresutls_v3.csv: This csv file contains the standard error of the average metrics obtained from running Trim32Analysis.R.

*** Folder: Section 4.2 ***
- GSE217352.R: Running this file will reproduce the analysis conducted in Section 4.2, as well as printing out Table 4.

*** Folder: SimResults ***
The csv files in this folder store the simulation results from Section 3. These files are read from other R files in the Section 3 and Supplementary folders to produce Table 1, Table 2, and Tables A1 to A4.

*** Folder: Supplementary ***
- TablesA1toA4.R: This R file reproduces Tables A1, A2, A3, and A4 as they appear in the supplementary materials.
