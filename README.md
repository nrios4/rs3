The rs3code_r1.zip file contains the R code needed to reproduce all results in the paper titled "Randomized Smart Subset Selection for High-Dimensional Generalized Linear Models with False Positive Control."

*** Folder: Section 3 ***
- SubsetSelectionSim.R: This is the R code used to run the simulations described in Section 3 of the main paper.
- SubsectSelectionSim_half_binary_predictors.R: This is the R code used to run the simulations as described in Section 3.1 of the main paper.
- Tables1and2.R: The R file reproduces Table 1 and Table 2 in the paper.
- Tables3and4.R: This R file reproduces Table 3 and Table 4 in the paper.

*** Folder: Section 4.1 ***
- Table5.R: This code reproduces Table 5 as it appears in the main paper.
- Table6.R: This code reproduces Table 6 as it appears in the main paper.
- Trim32Analysis.R: This R file was used to analyze the Trim32 dataset. It reproduces Table 5 and the values used to construct Table 6.
- trim32meanresults_v3.csv: This csv file contains the average metrics obtained from running Trim32Analysis.R.
- trim32seresutls_v3.csv: This csv file contains the standard error of the average metrics obtained from running Trim32Analysis.R.

*** Folder: Section 4.2 ***
- GSE217352-pairCV.R: Running this file will reproduce the analysis conducted in Section 4.2, as well as printing out Table 7.

*** Folder: SimResults ***
The csv files in this folder store the simulation results from Section 3. These files are read from other R files in the Section 3 and Supplementary folders to produce Tables 1 to 4, and Tables A1 to A13.

*** Folder: Supplementary ***
- TablesA1toA4.R: This R file reproduces Tables A1, A2, A3, and A4 as they appear in the supplementary materials.
- TablesA5toA8.R: This R file reproduces Tables A5, A6, A7, and A8 as they appear in the supplementary materials.
- TablesA9toA10.R: This R file reproduces Tables A9 and A10 as they appear in the supplementary materials.
- TablesA11toA12.R: This R file reproduces Tables A11 and A12 as they appear in the supplementary materials.
- TableA13.R: This R file reproduces Table A13 as it appears in the supplementary materials.
